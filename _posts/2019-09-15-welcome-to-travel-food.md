my google analytics showed a spike of visitors the last couple of days, specifically on friday. It seems my post on the new safari tools has caught the eye of someone important, as it looks like <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/author/factoryjoe/" >Chris Messina</a> posted it to the <a herf="http://ma.gnolia.com/groups/WebDevBlogs">Ma.gnolia.com web dev blogs group</a>.

To mangle a quote by Ron Burgandy, “i dont know if you know this, but he’s kinda a big deal”.

Chris is an open-source advocate, and is largely responsible for the mozilla based browser, <a href="http://flock.com/" >Flock</a> (even though he no longer works there). Actually, i found <a href="http://www.web20show.com/articles/2005/10/25/web-2-0-show-episode-5-chris-messina" >THIS list</a> of stuff he’s done, and considering he’s only 2 years older than me, i have some serious catching up to do.

But yeah, Chris likes my blog. I get the feeling that Chris is a humble web-pseudo-celebrity and will probably call me out on this, but hey, if he’s reading my blog, i think that’s awesome. Thanks for the traffic. Leave me a comment or something, let me know what you think, i’d love to talk shop.
