          <p>Hi, I'm Patterson. I'm a professional chef and independent recipe developer based in Philadelphia and I have an obsession for great food and drink. When it comes to travel, my #1 priority is knowing where I can get the best eats at all times. </p>

          <p>Each time my husband Alex or I book a trip, my first step is spending hours (sometimes days!) diving deep into every single nugget of food knowledge I can find...and I map it out, literally. </p>

          <img src="images/face-a-thumbsup.png" alt="Alex Hillman" style="width:49%; max-width:125px; float:left;margin-right:20px;" />
          <p><strong>These maps completely changed the way we travel.</strong> Every trip is planned around local and culturally relevant foodstuffs. </p>

          <p>Of course, we still do other "non-food" activities too. We love walking tours, museums, live music, etc.  <strong>But for us, food always comes first.</strong></p>

          <p> Through food, we've found friendships in foreign cities and wandered into unexpected experiences. We always come home from a trip with the best stories and memories.</p>

          <p>Food is truly is the universal language. And everybody has to eat. ðŸ˜‹</p>

          <p>Food is personal, an expression of culture and people. To fully experience a place, food is a good starting point. Great food is an experience that everyone can and should be able to enjoy.</p>

          <h3>Great food will enhance any travel experience by 10x, but you don't have to obsessively research like I do. </h3>

          <p>Any time a friend has used one of my lists, they've had the same kinds of amazing experiences we do. And even better, they said they never had to worry about a mediocre meal putting a damper on their trip, or the stress of choosing from too many options.</p>

          <p><strong>So after years of our people asking us to make our lists available, we've launched this site and our first three city guides are available now! </strong></p>

          <div id="toc-list">
            <a href="#nav-neworleans"><i class="mg map-us-la"></i><span>New Orleans, Louisiana</span></a>
            <a href="#nav-chicago"><i class="mg map-us-il"></i><span>Chicago, Illinois</span></a>
            <a href="#nav-portlandme"><i class="mg map-us-me"></i><span>Portland, Maine</span></a>
          </div>

          <p>More guides are on the way, too, including our favorite food cities: Lisbon/Porto, Cape Town/Stellenbosch, Prague, Portland Oregon, Washington DC, and more. For the most adventurous food travelers, we're working on guides from epic food destinations like Japan and India. Wherever you are, and whatever your favorite flavors may be, I have a map for you. </p>

          <p>Each of these guides (complete with interactive maps) are carefully curated from the giant list of more than 1000 places I've researched and visited. For each city, you can choose from a 24 hour guide or a 48 hour guide. For select cities and destinations, you can get a <em>full week's worth of curated recommendations</em>!</p>

          <p><strong>My goal is to make your travels delicious, too, and wherever you are going to ensure you never wonder where you should go to eat.</strong> Sign up for the list below, or grab a guide and plan your next trip around it. </p>

          <p>I promise, you won't go hungry.</p>

          <p><em>Deliciously yours,</em><br/>Chef Patterson Watkins & Alex Hillman</p>

          <img src="images/face-p-eating.png" alt="Chef Patterson Watkins" style="width:49%; max-width:250px;float:right;" />
          <p>This vibrant city is buzzing 365 days a year with opportunities abound for fabulous food, drink and fun. Trust us, we supped, we sipped and we supped some more (leading to a half-hearted attempt at a diet cleanse once we returned home).</p>
          <p>Our curated New Orleans food guides give you <strong>up to chef-selected 42 options for delicious destinations</strong> complete with gastronomic descriptions, tantalizing tips, and convenient Google Maps shortcuts (one click and 'poof' you'll have our Google maps loaded onto your device so you always know the tastiest spots nearby).</p>
