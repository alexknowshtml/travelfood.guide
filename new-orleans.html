<p>New Orleans is a domestic city with a foreign feel, steeped in European colonial history and further enhanced by African and American influences. Nola honors tradition and celebrates creativity with every bowl of gumbo, every seafood stuffed po'boy and every amply-sugared pillowy beignet.</p>

<p>This vibrant city is buzzing 365 days a year with opportunities abound for fabulous food, drink and fun. Trust us, we supped, we sipped and we supped some more (leading to a half-hearted attempt at a diet cleanse once we returned home).</p>
